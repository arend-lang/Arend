This release focuses primarily on internal enhancements aimed at improving overall stability.

Language updates:
<ul>
    <li>Introduce Arend server that store the state of the type-checker.</li>
    <li>Improved interaction between Java and Arend code.
        Previously, changes in Arend code that affected meta definitions required reloading the plugin; now they are picked up on the fly.</li>
    <li>Improved termination checking algorithm.</li>
    <li>Expressions before the dot are no longer restricted to variables.
        While previously e.f was allowed only when e was a variable, it can now be any expression.</li>
</ul>

Plugin updates:
<ul>
    <li>Arend server state tree view that displays the state of definitions stored on Arend server</li>
    <li>Visualization of call matrices that can be used to debug termination problems</li>
</ul>

arend-lib updates:
<ul>
    <li>Refactor the hierarchy of spaces, introducing extended (lower) metric spaces, normed Abelian groups, normed rings, Banach spaces, and Banach algebras</li>
    <li>Boolean algebras and Boolean rings</li>
    <li>New algebraic solvers (including a solver for Boolean rings)</li>
    <li>Real commutative C*-algebras</li>
    <li>Riesz spaces</li>
    <li>The Riesz space of simple functions on a Boolean ring</li>
    <li>Supremum and infimum of a set of real numbers</li>
    <li>Intermediate value theorem for monotone functions</li>
    <li>The root function for real numbers</li>
    <li>Closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean spaces are compact</li>

    <li>Schur's lemma</li>
    <li>Trace of a matrix</li>
    <li>Free groups</li>
