## Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/Arend
git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-arend.git
cd intellij-arend
```

## Building

We use gradle to build the plugin. It comes with a wrapper script (`gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` in
the root of the repository) which downloads appropriate version of gradle
automatically as long as you have JDK installed.

Common tasks are

  - `./gradlew buildPlugin` — fully build plugin and create an archive at
    `build/distributions` which can be installed into IntelliJ IDEA via `Install
    plugin from disk` action found in **File | Settings | Plugins**.

  - `./gradlew runIde` — run a development IDE with the plugin installed.

  - `./gradlew test` — run all tests.

## Developing

You can get the latest Intellij IDEA Community Edition
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

To import this project in IntelliJ, use **File | New | Project from Existing Sources**
and select `build.gradle` from the root directory of the plugin.

When hacking on the plugin, you may need the following plugins -

* **[Grammar-Kit](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6606-grammar-kit)** - 
BNF Grammars and JFlex lexers editor. Readable parser/PSI code generator.
* **[PsiViewer](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/227-psiviewer)** - 
A Program Structure Interface (PSI) tree viewer.

## Travis CI

The project is configured to build and run tests with Travis CI, which you can enable in your forks.
